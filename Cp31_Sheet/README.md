# 🏆 CP-31 Sheet (Codeforces)

This directory serves as a dedicated workspace for solving the **CP-31 Sheet**—a curated collection of 31 problems for each rating level (800 to 1600+) designed to systematically improve competitive programming skills on **Codeforces**.

### 🧪 Purpose
- **Systematic Growth:** Mastering standard techniques and observations required for each rating bracket.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying common greedy, DP, and constructive algorithms.
- **Speed & Accuracy:** Reducing implementation time using a standardized execution engine.

### ⚙️ Performance Template

I use a **Triple-Layer Architecture** for all solutions. This separates I/O orchestration from pure algorithmic logic, ensuring the "Engine" is decoupled from the data stream.
