# DSA-Playground 🚀

This repository is a personal playground for practicing and implementing Data Structures and Algorithms.

## 📦 Contents

- ✅ Classic DSA Implementations
    - Segment Trees, Graph Algorithms, Trees, Dynamic Programming etc.
  
## 💡 Practice Problems
This folder contains my personal solutions to problems from platforms like:

- Codeforces
- CSES
- SPOJ
- LeetCode
- GeeksforGeeks

## 📁 Structure

- `Implementations/`: Core DSA building blocks.
- `Problems/`: Solved problems from various coding platforms.
